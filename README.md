## Overview

Redux Enterprise is a library for scaling Redux-based projects that enforces the use of consistent and standardized reducers and actions by generating them from state modeling. As projects grow it quickly becomes critical to keep reducers lean, map actions to specific reducer handlers, and to standardize handling and naming for the typical best data structures found in Redux. The core Redux pattern of message passing, data immutibility, unidirectional flow, and all associated benefits remain, Redux Enterprise simply adds a layer of standarization and tooling so developers can be productive and continue moving quickly even as projects grow to dozens or hundreds of reducers and detailed pieces of state.

### Generate reducers actions and selectors from a data model
Redux Enterprise allows you to describe your core application state using a collection of high level data structures:
```js
import { Model, Types } from 'redux-enterprise'
const { Collection, Flag } = Types

Model({
  todos: {
    todos: Collection,
    isEditing: Flag
  },
  comments: Collection
})
```
### Fully compatible with any Redux based project - gradually introduce consistency
The library generates reducers and actions that can seamlessly be introduced into existing Redux projects. The standardized actions are automatically available on the Actions object:
```js
import { Actions } from 'redux-enterprise'

Actions.Todos.isEditing.set()
Actions.Todos.todos.add({ id: 1, message: 'Hello Burp Morty' })
Actions.Todos.todos.upsert({ id: 1, message: 'Hello Morty' })
```

### Get an auto-magic Redux REPL right in your browser console
When in dev mode Redux Enterprise also automagically provides an in-browser REPL for dispatching prebound actions or exploring data selectors:

## Add it to your project in under 5 minutes

#### Install
```sh
yarn add redux-enterprise
```

#### Configure your store
The easiest way to get reducers generated by Redux Enterprise plugged into your store is to find your call to Redux's `createStore` and configure it to asyncronously accept some async reducers:
```js
import { reducers } from 'redux-enterprise'

...

  const store = createStore(
    createRootReducer(reducers),
    initialState,
    bindMiddleware()
  )
  
...

```

#### Model some data
Open your reducers/index.js file or any other file that your project imports and use Redux Enterprise to model some new state. This will automatically add a `todos` reducer to your store and actions onto the Redux Enterprise `Actions` object, as well as directly on the browser console by name.
```js
import { Model, Types } from 'redux-enterprise'
const { Collection, Flag, Setable } = Types

Model({
  todos: {
    todos: Collection,
    isEditing: Flag,
    EditingId: Setable
  }
})
```

#### Play with the new reducer in your browser console
```js
> Todos.isEditing.toggle()
prev state {todos: { todos: {...}, isEditing: false, editingId: null }}
action {type: "todos/isEditing/toggle"}
next state {todos: { todos: {...}, isEditing: true, editingId: null }}
```
